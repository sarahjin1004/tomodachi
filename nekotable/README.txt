 As I visit a company website allowing me to download a CSV file (Comma Seperated Value), I find myself thinking: Why do they not draw a graph of the data? This is the first part on my way to make a CSV-Graph webpage, where I in this part convert the CSV file into a data structure. 
And just to see if it is working I convert the array to a Boostrap table. 
You may change the CSV data, and also feel free to reuse the csvToHtml function build in javascript.
